The banking sector produces large volumes of financial and customer-related data every day. To make better decisions, banks require clear insights on customer behaviours, transaction patterns, loan performance, and risk factors. A dashboard helps in monitoring this information in real time. This project, Banking Reporting & Insights Dashboard, focuses on creating an interactive dashboard using a sample banking dataset. The dashboard shows key metrics such as total customers, average transactions, loan summary, account distribution, and credit-risk patterns. It allows a bank manager or analyst to instantly understand business performance without manually calculating anything.The project mainly concentrates on data cleaning, data analysis and dashboard creation, without using any machine learning models.
