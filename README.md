Banking Reporting & Insights Dashboard
________________________________________
1. Introduction
The banking sector produces large volumes of financial and customer-related data every day. To make better decisions, banks require clear insights on customer behaviours, transaction patterns, loan performance, and risk factors. A dashboard helps in monitoring this information in real time.
This project, Banking Reporting & Insights Dashboard, focuses on creating an interactive dashboard using a sample banking dataset. The dashboard shows key metrics such as total customers, average transactions, loan summary, account distribution, and credit-risk patterns. It allows a bank manager or analyst to instantly understand business performance without manually calculating anything.
The project mainly concentrates on data cleaning, data analysis and dashboard creation, without using any machine learning models.
